## What is Book Bunch?

Contrary to popular belief, Millennials read more than older generations doâ€”and more than the last generation did at the same age! An [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/millennials-are-out-reading-older-generations/379934/) about the 2014 Pew Research Center report said that "Deeper connections with [books] are also often associated with key life moments such as having a child, seeking a job, being a student, and going through a situation in which research and data can help inform a decision." Soooo...basically all of your 20's! Everything on the internet is interconnected. What better place to have a list of the books you've found on forbes, ESPN, instagram, in a youtube video, amazon etc. that can help you tackle those life event than Book Bunch? 

Book Bunch is a virtual bookshelf CRUD app where users can: 
- View books on a user profile archived in the database
- Add books to the database(by searching the google books api)
- Edit books in the database, update the status of the book (read, reading, to-read), and add a review of the book
- And delete books from the database
